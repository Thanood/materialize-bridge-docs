# Introduction
<br>

The collection of articles contained in this **App developers tutorials** help category presents several short tutorials on using the **[Materialize components](../about_this_application/components_catalog.md)** from **[Aurelia-Materialize bridge](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/aurelia-materialize-bridge)** Aurelia plugin.
<br>

Specifically that means how you will develop the app which "hosts" the few selected controls (`select`, `button`, `slider` and `collapsible`).

<br>
**Note**: This tutorial uses the skeleton navigation and JSPM for simplicity. The skeleton navigation delivers everything you would need for a starting application. JSPM is used so you don't need to fiddle with webpack configuration.

This same application that you will build from the scratch, also exists in its finished form **[here](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/materialize-app-developers-tutorial)**, provided as a courtesy to allow you to "peek" into some details that might have escaped you.

Starting with one of the most simple components -  NavBar, we will show how this component can be added to the well known **[Aurelia Skeleton Navigation](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation/tree/master/skeleton-es2016)** app and then add several additional components (Select, Button, Slider and Collapsible).

By the end of the tutorial we will have completed the **[Materialize app developers tutorial](https://github.com/aurelia-ui-toolkits/materialize-app-developers-tutorial)**
